How many beautiful poetry will come to me?
Anyother mind of things are passed by along the wind. 

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="/img/9.jpg">
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/9.jpg">
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all. 
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="/img/8.jpg">
	<img class="col one" src="/img/10.jpg">
</div>

My stars are always lightning in the sky. 
Then all the things will show the mysteries of this universe.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg">
	<img class="col one" src="/img/12.jpg">
	<img class="col one" src="/img/7.jpg">
</div>
